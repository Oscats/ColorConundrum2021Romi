# ColorConundrum2021Romi
This is the code we submitted for the NEFirst Color Conundrum Challenge

Much of it is borrowed from the incredible work that @zhiquanyeo did to help us all learn how to use trajectories. Without him, we would be at a bit of a loss. You can access his repository [directly](https://github.com/bb-frc-workshops/romi-examples).
